# Validation record — 2026-09-27 KST

This is preview evidence, not an npm release or a claim of complete Python parity.
Python reference: v1.0.2, commit `47c23713d0a2a3c11ebde6186afd8c43489b8b65`.

## Automated checks

- 14 tests pass locally on macOS arm64 / Node 22.14.0.
- Real fixture SQLite DBs, Unix inbox sockets and separate C processes holding
  actual advisory locks; Python is the discovery oracle, not the implementation.
- Refused inactive/ambiguous/wrong-owner cases; one native fixture queue call;
  native nonzero after spawn and SSH response loss remain unknown with no retry.
- Package file allowlist, same-build repeat SHA-256, clean prefix installation,
  empty-PATH discovery and uninstall pass. npm audit reports 0 vulnerabilities.
- CI defines macOS/Linux × Node 22/24; see the repository Actions results for
  those runs rather than treating this local check as their substitute.

## Real TUI and SSH checks

Dedicated, newly created Claude/Codex test TUIs only. The user approved trusting
the two otherwise empty test folders. Agent permissions were not changed.
Each route passed discovery and no-delivery dry-run before exactly one send.
ACKs below were observed as separate **assistant response lines in the owned
live tmux panes**, not copied from submitted prompts, queues or transcript files.

| Route | Native target | Submission | Actual response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mac mini local | Claude Code 2.1.281 | posted | `ACK TS186-LOCAL-CLAUDE-8fc721d0` |
| Mac mini local | Codex CLI 0.157.1 | queued | `ACK TS186-LOCAL-CODEX-cb042ac9` |
| Mac mini → MacBook SSH | Claude Code 2.1.281 | posted | `ACK TS186-SSH-CLAUDE-f0275ade` |
| Mac mini → MacBook SSH, structured Reply-To URI as destination | Codex CLI 0.157.1 | queued | `ACK TS186-SSH-CODEX-a771e96c` |

Local Node: 22.14.0. Remote MacBook: 24.20.0, selected by a task-owned wrapper
because its normal PATH selected unsupported Node 26. KR Linux Node 24.16.0
also passed real SSH version negotiation and empty Claude discovery. KR native
agent delivery was not tested. No service was restarted or global CLI replaced.

The CLI itself still reports `consumptionConfirmed:false`; external ACK review
does not change that contract. This is a one-shot functional test, not a soak.
Local self-SSH was denied by the existing SSH authentication configuration; no
credentials or host-key bypass were introduced. Reverse SSH was not asserted.

## Historical runtime build checked on both Macs

Compiled module SHA-256 values matched between the local build and the isolated
MacBook installation used for the SSH ACK tests:

```

These hashes and real-TUI ACKs precede the public command rename to
`session-peer` (the npm package was then named `session-peer-ts`). The rename changes the
CLI version banner to `session-peer 0.1.0-preview.0 (typescript)` and the default
SSH executable to `session-peer`; it does not change native delivery logic.
Fresh package-install and SSH fixture tests cover the renamed entry point and
reject a different implementation on remote PATH before sending. The earlier
ACKs are not represented as a new live test of the renamed build.

The npm package name was subsequently changed to `session-peer` before a
successful publication; the GitHub repository remains `session-peer-ts`.
Package identity, tarball naming and publication confirmations are covered by
package/release fixtures, not claimed as new live ACK evidence.

## Not covered / not released

Windows, native x64 agent interaction, IPv6 literals, Relay/MCP/wake, full Python
CLI parity, automatic reverse-route detection, npm registry publishing and
provenance are outside this historical evidence. Publication preparation now
removes the private flag, but actual publishing still needs separate approval
and the gates in RELEASING.md. Native dependency prebuild availability must be tested
on each architecture claimed by a future release.
